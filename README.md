**My Messy Post-It Notes**

- These are my real post-it notes around my desk. 
- They are as un-ordered lists.
- They have no logical hierarchy.
- They might be wrong, misunderstood, confusing :/
- They seem chaotic, may be they are so :) 
- They are public because anybody would want to correct me â€¦
- Thank you :)

**SaaS, PaaS, IaaS**

    IaaS = Infrastructure as a Service
    PaaS = Platform as a Service
    SaaS = Software as a Service
    
    SaaS
        - Apllication data
        - Data
        - Runtime
        - OS
        
        IaaS & PaaS
            - Servers
            - Load Balancers
            - File Storage

**Pascal Pyramid**

if n is row order and k is the number order from left than n*th* rows k*th* number is = n!/ (k!*(n-k)!)

     1.     1
     2.    1 1
     3.   1 2 1
     4.  1 3 3 1
     .
     .
     .
     n. 1... k ...1
The number at the n*th* row and k*th* order is ``= n!/ (k!*(n-k)!)``

**Convert Map to Array**

``= Array.from(myMap)``

 
**Convert Array to Map**

``= new Map(myArray) `` 

_If array is a 2D key-value type array._

> For example: ``[[key1,val1],[key2,val2],[key3,val3]]``)

    const object = {x:42, y:50}
    const entries = Object.entries(object);
    // [['x',42],['y',50]]
    
    const result = Object.fromEntries(entries);
    // {x:42, y:50}
