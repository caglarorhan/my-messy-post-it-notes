**My Messy Post-It Notes**

- These are my real post-it notes around my desk. 
- They are as un-ordered list.
- They have no logical hierarchy.
- They seems chaotic, may be they are :) 
- They are public because anybody would want to correct me â€¦
- Thank you :)

**Pascal Pyramid**

if n is row order and k is the number order from left than n*th* rows k*th* number is = n!/ (k!*(n-k)!)

     1.     1
     2.    1 1
     3.   1 2 1
     4.  1 3 3 1
     .
     .
     .
     n. 1... k ...1
The number at the n*th* row and k*th* order is ``= n!/ (k!*(n-k)!)``
